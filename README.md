Android TV app built with Android Studio
The code is developed as a Mobile Android App, which is convertible to an Android TV app and can be run on an Android TV (Google TV) emulator. 
Initially, the app was based on Android TV Leanback library, which provides UI templates. We tried to build a core structure of a Smart TV app but 
in the process we realized that a Mobile App suitable for Android TV is more manageable for a short-time Project. However as a future goal, we would
like to implement the Leanback library to provide more look-and-feel.
